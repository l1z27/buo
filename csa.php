                <h1>About Our Upcoming 2021-2022 Winter Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Program</h1>
                
                <p><strong>Why A CSA?</strong><br />
                Imagine being able to pick up, locally grown, great tasting, farm fresh winter vegetables from a conveniently located farm. We make that possible through our Winter CSA program. And we’re in White Fence Farms in Palmdale, CA., located just one mile west of the Antelope Valley Mall. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>How Our Winter CSA Works </strong><br />
                For 13 consecutive weeks beginning on or about November 15th, 2021 you’ll come to our farm to pick up your produce. Once you’re here a box with your family name on it will be waiting for you to retrieve it. We take an initial deposit for the box, but assuming you return it each week, we’ll refund your deposit at the end of the season. This allows all members to save a few bucks and eventually pass those savings on to other members.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What Produce Will Be Available In The 2021 Winter CSA?</strong><br />
                We’re taking orders right now for membership in our Bottoms Up Winter CSA program.  Beginning November 15th, 2021, weather permitting of course, you’ll receive 8-12 freshly harvested vegetables once per week. Our current menu includes items like:
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li class="list__item">Salanova® Green Battavia Lettuce</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Kalebration Kale</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Auroch Spinach</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Daikon Radishes</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Arugula</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Bright Lights Swiss Chard</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Subeto Beets</li>
                    <li class="list__item">Divino Brussel Sprouts</li>
                </ul>
                 <p>Beginning in December there will occasionally be some surprise guests on the weekly menu as well––all included in your annual membership share.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What Does The CSA Cost?</strong><br />
                The cost of your Winter CSA membership is $400, is paid up front, yet on a weekly basis equates to roughly $30.00 per week.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Is My Membership In The CSA Refundable?</strong><br />
                Unfortunately, due to weather and pests, things outside of our control that can sometimes destroy an entire crop, winter shares must be non-refundable. Bottoms Up Organics however won’t take your hard-earned money without you receiving something in return. If things like weather or pests damage or destroy a crop, we’ll carry forward 35% of your Winter membership share towards the next CSA. We anticipate that CSA will begin late Spring 2022.
