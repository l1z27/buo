                <h1>My Bottom’s Up Backstory</h1>
                <p>As a Management Consultant and Process Engineer, all over the globe I’ve spent thousands of hours trying to Continuously Improve people and process. I guarantee most folks I meet just one thing: To improve people requires a lot of heavy lifting.</p> 

                <p>None of my Lean Leadership and Management experiences, however, ever prepared me for how hard it is to become an organic farmer. Until as a hobby and out of necessity I decided it was time to learn how to become one.</p> 

                <p>My wife thought and still thinks I am nuts for taking the time required to learn how to become a farmer, and maybe she’s right. But I know deep down in my soul that a farmer’s life is indeed for me. </p>

                <p>Initially, the process side of farming got me hooked. So I began studying any process that could reduce the amount of time it took to do my daily farm chores. That included: feeding my thirty or so animals, dealing with their poop, and gathering eggs from our twenty or so laying hens and ducks.</p>

                <p>As I started dealing with managing the manures from all those different animals, I began studying composting, how worms work, soil science, and biology. This began my infatuation with worms, the soil, and how to utilize nature and those worms to improve soil from manure via the vermi-composting process. Vermi-composting is a process where worms excrete a casting from pre-composted manures. And that finished product I discovered––the worm casting, is teeming with microbial life and activity!</p>

                <p>Five years later and the composting and vermi-composting process fascinates me more than ever. And for purposes of continuous improvement and time savings, my traditional composting process, one that used to take 8-9 months, now takes just 18 days! </p>

                <p>We use that compost on our standardized 30’ by 30” growing beds. We’ve also developed a method that simultaneously improves the soil using Red Wiggler worms at the same time we’re getting a seed or transplant ready to go into the ground. When we’re ready to plant or transplant––just 43 days from the day our initial compost process began, the little worm buggers––tens of thousands of Eisenia Foetida––have then turned our hand-crafted compost into an even more incredible vermi-compost growing media. </p>

                <p>We’re now so good at producing our own high-quality worm castings in fact, that we now sell a limited supply of our excess worm castings and worm teas at various retail locations throughout Southern California. 
                    (You Can Also Occasionally Order Them Directly From Us Here)</p>

                <p>What comes out of those worm castings is produce that’s taste is both highly nutritious and extraordinarily delicious. There’s a wonderful flavor to our lettuces and spinaches, and our arugulas are off the charts spicy. Our Kalebration Kale is exquisite, as is our spinach mustard. And don’t get me started on the flavor of our Banana and Bell Peppers or our San Marzano Tomatoes!</p>

                <p>Lastly, I’m a big believer in freely giving of my time to help others improve themselves and their families. Therefore, I’m constantly being asked to share my knowledge with people young and old who are looking to farm or simply improve their life. </p>

                <p>I don’t charge for what I’ve learned as a first-generation farmer. I’m always learning more, and I’m willing to help you too. Feel free to reach out to me with your farming challenges and other things you’re looking to improve. </p>
