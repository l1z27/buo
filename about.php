                <h1>Why Bottom’s Up Organics?</h1>
                <p>It’s part of the natural order of life for vegetables to be grown in the ground. Just like the human soul, the ground beneath your feet requires continuous nourishment and improvement. Feed and enrich that soil properly, and over time it will repay you with great tasting, nutritionally dense, pesticide and fertilizer free, food. </p>

                <p>Global chemical manufacturers and supermarkets, however––whose commercial interests serve the taste buds of Wall Street rather than Your Street––have convinced many farmers that the best way to increase food production and taste is to chemically alter the soil your food grows in. And that means constantly tilling the soil and increasingly adding more and more chemicals to it.</p>

                <p>At Bottoms Up Organics, using no fertilizers or pesticides and only what nature provides us, we improve our soil with composts handcrafted on our farm. That compost comes primarily from our own farm animals. In addition, when it’s possible, we avoid tilling our soils. When we must till the soil, however, we prefer to do it by hand, using nothing more than a pitchfork and some good old fashioned hard work and process ingenuity. </p>

                <p>Instead of tractors and chemicals to aerate and improve our soils, hundreds of thousands of worms regularly invigorate and aerate our farm’s Terra Firma. Beyond the process of our hand-crafted compost, our 300K Red Wiggler Worms process it further into Bottoms Up Organics nutrient dense, rich, black organic soil.  A soil that gives our produce great taste and greatly enhanced nutritional value.</p>

                <p>At Bottom’s Up Organics we’re improving the food you eat by continuously improving the soil in which it’s grown.</p>

                <p>Welcome to our family. </p>
