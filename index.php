        <h1 class="h-center">Welcome To Bottoms Up Organics, The Next Generation of Farming Nature’s Way. </h1>
        <p>Pesticide and fertilizer free, our vegetables are grown in soils we continuously improve. We hand-craft those soils. Using just a pitchfork and Red Wiggler earth worms to continually increase the functionality of our soil, we’re forever ever improving and changing soil’s biology. We’re unlocking the good bacteria and fungal based activity that’s dormant in most soils. We’re doing so by eliminating the use of chemicals and tilling practices which destroy the life of what’s living in the soil that the naked eye simply can’t see.</p>
        <p>While the methods we use to improve our soils and grow our crops have been in existence for years, as process engineers and growers who appreciate nature’s way, we know that nothing is ever perfect and as it seems. In fact, too many people let their perfect get in the way of someone else’s better––a practice we avoid at all cost on our small family farm. </p>
        <p>At Bottoms Up Organics we’re both proponents and professional practitioners of Kaizen, a Japanese practice that loosely translated means:</p>
        <blockquote>
        "Continuously Bringing About Change For The Better."
        </blockquote>
        <p>Whether we’re farming, consulting to Senior Management, or leading teams in kaizen events around the globe, we’re teaching and continuously learning the benefits of Kaizen from others. For us, in farming Continuous Change For The Better is a way of life and thinking, not an activity.</p>
        <p>Please join us on our path to improve your produce using the experience underlying what nature offers all of us. </p>
        <p>Cheers and Bottoms Up!</p>
